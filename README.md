# Data Science Projects

Welcome to my repository of projects. These projects cover various data science concepts, tools, and techniques, showcasing my practical experience in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **Corporate Bankruptcy Prediction**
   - **Objective**: Predict corporate bankruptcy using financial ratios and machine learning models.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Data preprocessing: Handling missing values and outliers.
     - Feature engineering: Creating new financial indicators and selecting features using LASSO regression.
     - Modeling: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM, XGBoost, and Balanced Random Forest.
     - Evaluation: Prioritized F-beta score and recall metrics.
   - **Skills**: Python, pandas, scikit-learn,SMOTE, F-beta score

### 2. **Airbnb Price Prediction**
   - **Objective**: Predict listing prices based on location, amenities, and other features.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Geospatial analysis: Calculated distance to downtown using latitude and longitude.
     - Feature encoding: Applied one-hot and binary encoding for categorical features.
     - Text analysis: Used TF-IDF vectorization for processing textual data.
     - Modeling: Lasso Regression, Random Forest, GBM, XGBoost, MLP, and Weighted Averaged Ensemble
     - Evaluation: Used MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² to assess model performance.
   - **Skills**: Python, pandas, scikit-learn,TF-IDF, data visualization.

Each subfolder contains detailed notebooks and scripts demonstrating the application of these techniques. Feel free to explore and reach out with any questions or feedback.
